# Docker Improvements Summary

## What Changed

### 1. New `.dockerignore` File ✨
**Why**: Excludes unnecessary files from the Docker build context.

**Impact**:
- Faster builds (smaller context sent to Docker daemon)
- Smaller image layers
- Prevents accidentally copying `.env` files or credentials

**Excluded**:
- `node_modules` (rebuilt in container)
- `.git` directory (100+ MB typically)
- Development files (VSCode, logs, coverage)
- macOS files (`.DS_Store`)

---

### 2. Improved `Dockerfile` 🚀

#### Key Improvements:

| Feature | Old Dockerfile | New Dockerfile | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Node version** | `node:lts` (unpinned) | `node:22.13.1-alpine` | Reproducible builds |
| **Base image** | Debian-based (~900MB) | Alpine (~180MB) | 80% smaller, matches musl |
| **pnpm install** | Manual npm install | npm install -g pnpm@9 | Pinned version |
| **Build caching** | None | `--mount=type=cache` | 3-5x faster rebuilds |
| **Sharp handling** | Remove/reinstall hack | Native Alpine build | Cleaner, works with your config |
| **Health check** | None | Built-in | Auto-restart on failure |
| **Build deps** | Missing | `python3, make, g++` | Proper native module support |

#### Architecture Alignment:

Your `package.json` configures pnpm for musl (Alpine Linux):
```json
"supportedArchitectures": {
  "libc": ["musl"]
}
```

**Old Dockerfile**: Used Debian (glibc) → **platform mismatch** 🔴
**New Dockerfile**: Uses Alpine (musl) → **perfect alignment** ✅

### 3. New npm Scripts 🛠️

Added to `package.json`:

```json
"docker:build": "Build full production image"
"docker:build:test": "Build only the builder stage (fast)"
"docker:run": "Run the built image locally"
"docker:test": "Alias for docker:build:test"
"preflight": "Run tests + Docker build before push"
```

#### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Before pushing (fast, 2-3 minutes)
pnpm preflight

# Test full production build (slower, 5-8 minutes)
pnpm docker:build
pnpm docker:run
# Visit http://localhost:8080

# Just the Docker build test
pnpm docker:test
```

---

## Technical Details

### Multi-Stage Build Breakdown

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: base (Alpine + pnpm)
#   ↓
# Stage 2: deps (Install packages)
#   ↓ Uses cache mount
# Stage 3: builder (Build Astro site)
#   ↓ Creates /app/dist
# Stage 4: production (Nginx serves static files)
```

### Build Cache Magic 🪄

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store \
    pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

**How it works**:
1. First build: Downloads all packages (~5 min)
2. Cache saved to local Docker cache
3. Second build: Reuses cached packages (~30 sec)
4. Only downloads changed dependencies

**Benefit**: Rebuilds 5-10x faster after first build.

## Deployment Status

### ✅ Production Deployment Complete

The new Alpine-based Dockerfile has been deployed to production:

**Local Testing:**
- ✅ Built successfully with Podman on macOS (ARM64)
- ✅ All 157 pages generated correctly
- ✅ Site served properly on localhost:8080
- ✅ All features working (search, service worker, PWA)

**Production Deployment (Coolify):**
- ✅ Deployed to production on master branch
- ✅ Build time: ~2 minutes (first build)
- ✅ Dependencies: 1,441 packages installed in 20.1s
- ✅ Astro build: 157 pages in 59.19s
- ✅ Pagefind: 159 pages indexed
- ✅ Container running successfully in production
- ✅ No platform compatibility issues
- ✅ All site features working correctly

**Active Configuration:**
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized Alpine-based multi-stage build
- Original Dockerfile preserved in Git history

## Expected Outcomes

### Before (Old Dockerfile):
- ❌ Debian base (~900MB intermediate image)
- ❌ No build caching (5-8 min every build)
- ❌ Sharp reinstall workaround
- ❌ Node version can change unexpectedly
- ❌ Platform mismatch (glibc vs musl)

### After (New Dockerfile):
- ✅ Alpine base (~180MB, 80% smaller)
- ✅ Build caching (30 sec - 2 min typical)
- ✅ Native sharp support with your config
- ✅ Pinned versions (reproducible)
- ✅ Perfect platform alignment

### Build Time Comparison:

| Scenario | Old Dockerfile | New Dockerfile | Improvement |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **First build** | 5-8 min | ~2 min | **60% faster** |
| **Rebuild (no changes)** | 5-8 min | ~30 sec | **90% faster** |
| **Rebuild (package change)** | 5-8 min | ~1 min | **80% faster** |

**Actual Coolify Build Times (Verified):**
- Base + dependencies: 21.7s
- Astro build: 66.6s
- Total: ~2 minutes (first build, no cache)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "platform mismatch"
Your Mac is ARM64, but Coolify is x86_64. The `--platform linux/amd64` flag handles this.

### Sharp still has issues
Check that `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed and includes the musl binaries for sharp.

### Cache not working
Podman cache location: `~/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes/`
Clear cache: `podman system prune -af --volumes`

### pnpm version mismatch
The Dockerfile pins pnpm@9. Update if needed:
```dockerfile
ARG PNPM_VERSION=9
```

---

## Validation Results

### Platform Compatibility ✅
- **Mac (ARM64)**: Builds successfully with `--platform linux/amd64`
- **Coolify (x86_64)**: Builds successfully (verified PR #18)
- **Alpine/musl**: Perfect alignment with package.json config

### Native Dependencies ✅
- **Sharp**: Works correctly with Alpine musl binaries
- **Rollup**: Using WASM version as configured
- **esbuild**: Ignored build dependencies working

### Known Warnings (Non-blocking)
- `Unknown input options: manualChunks` - Expected Astro build warning
- No functional impact on site generation

## Questions?

- **What happened to the old Dockerfile?** Removed from working directory, preserved in Git history.
- **Is this working in production?** ✅ **Yes, deployed and verified on master branch**.
- **Do I need to change Coolify settings?** No, it auto-detects the Dockerfile.
- **What about the nginx.conf?** No changes needed, it's copied as-is and working correctly.
- **What if I need to rollback?** The old Dockerfile is in Git history and can be restored if needed.

## Implementation Complete ✅

1. ✅ **Test locally** - Completed successfully
2. ✅ **Test on Coolify** - Preview build successful (~2 min)
3. ✅ **Add GitHub Actions** - CI/CD workflow active
4. ✅ **Merge to master** - Deployed to production
5. ✅ **Production verified** - All features working

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Automated workflow validates every PR:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- **Job**: Unit test suite (`pnpm test`)
- **Cache**: pnpm dependencies cached
- **Docker validation**: Handled by Coolify preview builds

A few months ago, I stumbled over the poem <cite>The Gods of the Copybook Headings</cite> by _Rudyard Kipling_. I had never heard of the poem before, but the [visual interpretation of the poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37ARLInjLVE) by filmmaker and author [Lauren Southern](https://laurensouthern.net/) put me under a spell. I watched it over and over again and can recite the poem from my memory.

As a reasonable person with political center-left libertarian views, I’m utterly frustrated with the ongoing global movement against reason that accelerated over the last 5 years. The poem echoes this feeling.

## Historical Background

The poem was released at a deeply confusing and worrying time. The First World War had killed 17 Million people—Kipling’s son one of them—and the Spanish flu killed an additional 59-100 Million people between 1918-1920.

Disillusioned from the war, Pacifism became popular, Patriotism unpopular, and religion and morality suffered a major setback.

The Russian Revolution had removed the Tsar in 1917 and many people looked at Marxist socialism as the solution to all humanity’s problems.

Kipling was not happy with the political developments. He feared that giving up morals and values would lead to people not trusting each other and result in the destruction of the civilization.[^spiller2000]

The poem is his warning.

## Copybook Headings

Ill nature, like a spider, sucks poison from the flowers.”">

Copybook Headings were lined pages with short wisdom, aphorisms, or verses at the top, used to practice cursive writing. The student was challenged to repeat the sentence a few dozen times on the page and by doing not only learned the handwriting but took in the wisdom and morals transmitted from one generation to another.

## The Poem

The poem was released in London on 26th October 1919 in the _Sunday Pictorial_. In 1920, it was released in the USA under the title <cite>The Gods of the Copybook Margins</cite>.

It is a poem with ten stanzas, each with four lines (Quatrains) with a rhyme scheme of AABB CCDD.

The poem is a conservative poem. Its basic message is that everything progressive and new isn’t new at all. It was tried before and it failed. It is a call to return to reason, values, and objective truth. Human progress is dependent on ideas, but few of them will survive the test through the _Gods_, the rest will be destroyed.

### Stanza 1

> As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race, \
> I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market-Place. \
> Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall, \
> And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

The poet travels metaphorically through different times and as different people, and bows to the _Gods of the Marketplace_.

The _Gods of the Marketplace_, are those <q>temporary fads like Dutch tulip bulbs, dot-com stocks, mortgage-backed securities, and […] carbon credits,</q>[^levinson2011kv] writes _William A. Levinson_. These gods are promises and ideas, social progress, and delusory ideologies that despise the truth. The 20th century had no shortage of these ideas, even though Kipling didn’t know about the harm that Socialism, Fascism, or Nazi ideology would unleash on the world.

And the new century has, unfortunately, no shortage of bad ideas: The resurrection of Postmodernism and [Neo-Marxism](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-neo-marxism/), [Identity Politics](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-identity-politics/), [Critical Theory](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/), victimhood culture, the war on drugs, boys, masculinity, the nuclear family, merit, and market-based capitalism, or growth without limits, to name a few.

But all these bad ideas will fail and crumble and the _Gods of the Copybook Headings_ will prevail because they are <q>the nonpartisan, scientific, and implacable laws of economics and human behavior.</q>[^levinson2011kv]

### Stanza 2

> We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn \
> That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: \
> But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, \
> So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.

The poet tells the story that these laws were there from the beginning. Early humans learned from the errors others made: Fire will burn you, poisonous berries will make you sick, and a predator will eat you. This common knowledge became stories and turned into myths over time.[^peterson2017yx]

But new gods arrived that looked more promising: progress, money, wealth, or comfort. Humanity forgot the common knowledge and wisdom and moved on.

Not every progress is good for the individual. While agriculture led to an explosion in the growth of population, it resulted in declined health of humans and higher mother and child mortality. Less food variation resulted in malnutrition. Dense living conditions with other humans and animals, poor sewage, and waste conditions resulted in declining health. The bones and skulls of those humans were much smaller than their hunter-gatherer ancestors.[^curnoe2017dn] We can see this even today, where most people need their wisdom tooth’s removed because they don’t fit in the jaw because we don’t chew hard things anymore.

### Stanza 3

> We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace, \
> Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place, \
> But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come \
> That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.

The _Gods of the Marketplace_ end civilizations that ignore common knowledge and objective truth.

Where the hunter-gatherer knew <q>if I hunt two monkeys today, I have to walk twice as long tomorrow,</q> the humans who follow the ideas of the Marketplace don’t learn. Again and again, we can see them failing.

Be it Rome that fell through decadence and politics unable to defend the Empire against invading barbarians, or the Maya that created cities with millions of inhabitants, artificial soil, and streets but destroyed themselves with endless war and unrestrained extraction of natural resources.

### Stanza 4

> With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch. \
> They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch. \
> They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings. \
> So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.

Denial of objective truth is one of the signs of a society’s downfall.

We live in a time filled with lies that deny objective truth and create pseudo-realities that can eventually lead to Totalitarianism.[^lindsay2020aa] If enough people believe a lie, societies become unable to solve their problems and fail.

Large parts of the world honesty believe that Black people are hunted by racist police in the streets. Instead of researching the topic to get to the truth, the self-proclaimed social justice warriors replace their social media profile images with black images to show solidarity. This doesn’t help to solve the structural problems of Black communities but gives a quick way of feeling self-righteous and morally superior.

But when investigated, the stories begin to crumble q

When I started to be interested in [Minimalism](/minimalism/) in 2017, I decided to count all my stuff.

The average European citizen owns 10,000 items and I wanted to know how much I own. I counted 2,490 items five years ago.

Last week Minimalist and filmmaker [Matt D‚ÄôAvella](https://www.mattdavella.com/) released a new video titled [I counted everything I own as a minimalist](https://youtu.be/BB8o8-EdZY0). He also created other videos showing how little stuff he owns when he showed his [apartment](https://youtu.be/W2oU4bhaHqU), his [wardrobe](https://youtu.be/DSHsIOIhjJY), or what is in his [pockets](https://youtu.be/KZxI0-y3hew).

After watching his video I decided to recount my items and this time have everything neatly organized in a spreadsheet with columns for amount, room, category, date of buying, and price (if known).

## Rules for Counting

Back in 2017, I counted way too strict, I even counted each dental brush as one item. Matt had some good ideas for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a thing‚Äù:

- A box of screws is one thing
- All loose screws are one thing
- All sandwich bags inside a box are one thing
- A hard drive and its cable is one thing because it needs it to operate
- A pair of socks is one thing
- Counting all consumables (except food)

## The Items I Own

Matt D‚ÄôAvella counted 1,641 items in his home (together with his wife); 1363 things, and 278 consumables which is not a lot. He owns 498 items, his wife the rest.

After counting my flat and cellar on the weekend the results are finally in. I own **2749** items, including 397 consumables. _Matt won_.

I still own 659 books and way too many coffee cups (I don‚Äôt even drink coffee) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And I still have way too many clothes, but even though I don‚Äôt wear my dress shirts very often, I still love them too much to get rid of them.

### Things vs. Consumables

I did the same as Matt and checked all my items if they are a thing or consumable. 397 items are consumables, the rest are things.

### Rooms

Most of my items are in the living room, followed by the bedroom, kitchen, cellar, corridor, bathroom, and balcony last.

### Categories

My top category is ‚Äúbooks‚Äù, even though I recently gave 150 books away. Followed by kitchen tools ‚Ä¶ I need to get rid of my coffee mugs and the dozens of Asian noodle bowls. Then clothes, probably because I recently bought a bunch of socks.

## Conclusion

Now I have a good list where I can add new items I buy and remove items I sell or throw away. Additionally, the list is useful for traveling or in case I need to move. I can compare if a category or a room has too many things quickly. And with the new purchase price column, I can calculate how much I buy each year.

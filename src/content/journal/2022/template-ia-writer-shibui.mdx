After I finished my [first template](/template-ia-writer-nanzan/), I decided to create my second template immediately, based on the aesthetic style I used for my branding. I called it [Shibui](https://github.com/kogakure/ia-writer-template-shibui) (渋い) because that is the style I based my design on.

The template comes with a light and dark design, and I’ll improve it, probably over time. To check up on changes, feel free to watch the GitHub repository. If you find any issues, please open an issue on the repository.

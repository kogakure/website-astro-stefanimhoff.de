## Color Palette for Graphic Software

During a visit to the art exhibition _Japan and the West_ in the [Art Museum Wolfsburg](https://www.kunstmuseum-wolfsburg.de/), I was able to get my hands on a wonderful book about the traditional, Japanese colors.

In the museum shop, I bought the book _<AffiliateLink asin="4894445786" text="The Traditional Colors of Japan" />_ which is in Japanese. In addition to a full-color palette of 250 colors, it contains an exact indication of RGB, CMYK, and other information.

Each page of the book shows three colors that are always juxtaposed with one or more stunning photos. The photos show the traditional use of colors in kimonos, samurai armor, monk clothing, or nature.

I took the time to create the RGB palette with the correct color names as an Adobe Exchange file (ASE). This color palette can be used in Photoshop or Illustrator.

## A Long List of Things to Do

The novel Coronavirus _SARS-CoV-2_ which can lead to the sickness of _COVID-19_ brought many countries into partial or total lockdown. Many people are not used to staying inside for a long time. As an introvert, I like it inside.

To help others and make it easier to stay inside, I created this list of **101 things** you can do until this crisis is over:

1. **Learn Sketchnotes** – All you need is a pen and a notebook. A good start is <ProductLink asin="0321857895" text="The Sketchnote Handbook" /> by _Mike Rohde_ or the book [UZMO – Thinking With Your Pen](https://us.neuland.com/literature/specialist-books/uzmo-thinking-with-your-pen-english.html).
2. **Improve Your Handwriting** – There are many nice handwriting styles, why not learn <ProductLink asin="088062096X" text="Spencerian Penmanship" />? All you need is a pen.
3. **Start a Journal** – Uncounted famous people have written in a journal. Start small with the [One Line A Day Journal](https://myinnercreative.com/45-ways-to-create-one-line-a-day-in-your-bullet-journal/) or [The Five-Minute Journal](https://thehustle.co/the-five-minute-journal-will-make-you-happier).
4. **Care About a Bonsai** – You can buy a small tree and a pot, wire, and scissors. Here is [How to Start With Bonsai](https://youtu.be/eMPCDopQBII). Bonsai need a lot of care, but it’s an incredible art form, as shown in the short film [American Shokunin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfdGGTb5_Ts).
5. **Get House Plants** – Buy houseplants and care for them. They improve the look of your rooms and create good air. You can learn a lot about houseplants on [Summer Rayne Oakes YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/summerrayneoakes).
6. **Learn to Draw** – All you need is a notebook, pencil, pen, or coal and an introduction by _Alphonso Dunn_. His [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LighterNoteProd) is fantastic, and he wrote a few [books](https://www.amazon.de/Alphonso-Dunn/e/B019I2V23Y).
7. **Learn Urban Sketching** – Similar to learning drawing is Urban Sketching. It’s less realistic and more sketchy. You can start with a ballpoint pen and a notebook and later use watercolor to make it colorful. _Jens Hübner_ is a good start, he has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/emasniered) and wrote [multiple books](https://www.amazon.de/Jens-H%25C3%25BCbner/e/B00QP19ONC). _Peter Sheeler_ has a fantastic [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWYIO-v3dYNkhBjxFEYZ0g) about urban sketching.
8. **Learn to Paint** – If you want to learn to paint, _Bob Ross_ is a fantastic start. His [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc) has hours of free paint courses.
9. **Learn to Doodle** – Doodling is similar to Sketchnotes, but you don’t plan your doodle, you draw what comes to your mind. Here is a nice [video](https://youtu.be/e4N882MPTPQ) of what a doodle looks like.
10. **Do Blackout Poetry** – You need an old newspaper or book and a black marker. You search for single words that build a sentence or poem when read in order. Then you paint everything except your selected words black. Here is an introduction [video](https://youtu.be/Nt5nguT3hEM).
11. **Learn Hand Lettering** – You need fancier brush pens for this. But there are techniques with double lines. This is a nice [introduction](https://youtu.be/0LpJpxqDHgg).
12. **Learn Shodō Calligraphy** – Shodō is Japanese calligraphy. You need a few bamboo brushes, black ink, and good paper. It’s possible to buy an <ProductLink asin="B07CBVDNNB" text="introduction set" /> like this. Here is a [nice introduction video](https://youtu.be/8FWxOiGlt3c) by a Japanese calligraphy master.
13. **Learn Sumi-e Painting** – To learn the art of Japanese watercolor painting, you need the same tools as for Shodō. Here is a nice [introduction](https://youtu.be/Xncb1-wHM3k).
14. **Learn Origami** – All you need is paper and your hands. You can find hundreds of folding instructions on the Internet. _Jo Nakashima_ has a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/jonakashima) for Origami tutorials.
15. **Learn Kirigami** – Kirigami is similar to Origami, but you don’t fold, you cut. A knife, ruler, and scissors are tools you’ll need. Here is an [introduction video](https://youtu.be/6C5AbMSrmPY).
16. **Learn About Typography** – There is much to learn about typography. <ProductLink asin="0881792128" text="The Elements of Typographic Style" /> by _Robert Bringhurst_, is an excellent book about the topic.
17. **Declutter your Home** – There are countless methods to clean up your home. A good start is _Marie Kondo’s_ book <ProductLink asin="B01LWIRYMS" text="The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying"/>. She hosts the TV Show [Tidying Up with Marie Kondo](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/85202-tidying-up-with-marie-kondo) <NetflixFlag id="80209379" />. You can watch [Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/392553-minimalism-a-documentary-about-the-important-things) <NetflixFlag id="80114460" /> to get more inspirations on how to declutter and simplify your home.
18. **Improve your Balcony or Terrace** – If you have to stay home, you can make your outside space (if you have one) prettier. Get inspiration on my [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.de/kogakure/interior-balcony-terrace/).
19. **Cook Something Fantastic** – Why not try the [German Wedding Soup](https://www.thespruceeats.com/german-wedding-soup-recipe-hochzeitssuppe-1447335)? The soup of my grandmother will be better, but you should try it nevertheless.
20. **Play Lego** – It doesn’t need to be fancy. Buy a <ProductLink asin="B00PY3EYQO" text="classic box" /> and start being creative. Or buy the re-released [Pirates of Barracuda Bay](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pirates-of-barracuda-bay-21322), first released in 1989.
21. **Learn Fancy Shoe Lacing Styles** – Did you know? There is [more than one way to lace your shoes](https://youtu.be/5bHGLNB8sxQ).
22. **Learn About Japanese Design** – You can read about all the different styles in <ProductLink asin="4805312505" text="Japanese Design: Art, Aesthetics & Culture" />, read <ProductLink asin="0714866962" text="WA: The Essence of Japanese Design" /> or have a look in the books of [Kenya Hara](https://www.amazon.de/Kenya-Hara/e/B01LOM7Q68).
23. **Urban Dictionary** – Have a look into [The Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/). It’s hilarious. Every day there is a new word, you never heard of. It’s funny.
24. **Read or Write Haiku** – Haiku are short Japanese poems. 5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables. They are fun to read and fun to write. You can start reading the haiku of the master: <ProductLink asin="0140441859" text="Matsuo Basho" />. I tried [haiku](https://www.stefanimhoff.de/haiku/) myself, but they are nothing compared to his haiku.
25. **Read Poetry** – There are many poets to pick from. [Epitaph for “Poet’s Tomb”](https://www.poetryinternational.org/pi/poem/23081/auto/0/0/Shuntaro-Tanikawa/EPITAPH-FOR-POETS-TOMB/) by _Shuntaro Tanikawa_ is my favorite poem. It gets recited in the short film [Hikari](https://youtu.be/__xVbrDvunY) (1:52). Watch it!
26. **Learn to Code** – It’s always useful to know how to code. I recommend [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It’s free and leads you from the basics to becoming a professional developer. They additionally have hundreds of hours of free [video courses](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).
27. **Learn to Write** – Start with a few words or a short story. Or you could write a book. Learn about the [8-Point Story Arc](https://youtu.be/W0HEqI3pJIM) to improve your writing.
28. **Build Yourself a Website** – If you don’t know how to code, do not despair. You can set up a website without technical knowledge on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com) or [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com).
29. **Start a Blog** – If you have a website, you can start writing a blog. We need more blogs with interesting topics. You might know a few topics better than most people. Write about it.
30. **Learn Design & Illustration** – You don’t need expensive software to start. Try [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/). It costs less than €50 and is powerful. I do all my designs with it: Websites, Flyer, Logos, … They have hundreds of [video tutorials](https://affinity.serif.com/learn/) and multiple books.
31. **Improve Your Math** – The [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a free resource to learn everything about math, from preschool to university levels. The content is better than that in most schools. And they have more than math, courses on science & engineering and arts & the humanities.
32. **Learn a Language** – You can learn on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) for free. They have courses in so many languages, you can even learn _High Valyrian_, _Klingon_ or _Navajo_. I learn _Spanish_ and _Japanese_ every day.
33. **Learn 3D Creation** – Not long ago, 3D software cost thousands of dollars. But today you can learn for free with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Modeling, Sculpting, Animation & Rigging, and Rendering. I’m doing the course [Complete Blender Creator: Learn 3D Modelling for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/blendertutorial/) on Udemy.
34. **Learn About Stoicism** – This Greek philosophy is helpful to deal with hard times and develop a good character. You can start with this book: <ProductLink asin="0735211736" text="The Daily Stoic" />. The author _Ryan Holiday_ runs a [website and blog](https://dailystoic.com/) and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkUaT0T03TJvafYkfATM2Ag). Watch [The philosophy of Stoicism](https://youtu.be/R9OCA6UFE-0) to learn the basics. Next, you can read the book <ProductLink asin="B000FC1JAI" text="Meditations" /> by the Roman emperor <ProductLink asin="B000FC1JAI" text="Marcus Aurelius" />. His first sentence of book two was turned into a [comic](https://zenpencils.com/comic/aurelius/) by _Gavin Aung Than_.
35. **Learn About Taoism** – The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu founded a philosophy similar to Stoicism. He wrote the short book <ProductLink asin="B07FKWDY24" text="Tao Te King" />. It’s short, dense, and not easy. The philosopher Chuang Tzu wrote <ProductLink asin="B002RI99KU" text="another book" /> about Taoism that is much more poetic.
36. **Learn Meditation** – Meditation and mindfulness is not an esoteric humbug, the scientific evidence of the benefits is vast. Sitting down every day for 10-20 minutes will improve your health and psyche. I recommend learning it with [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). The app has a free introduction course, and the paid version has uncounted courses, short meditations, daily topics, blog posts, sleep sounds, podcasts and music, and even a movement section.
37. **Learn Calisthenics** – You don’t need a gym to get fit. The last time I’ve been to the gym was 20 years ago. All you need is the floor. You can start with Push-ups. Later you can buy a Pull-up bar for your door or gymnastic rings. That’s all you need. I wrote a [blog post](/calisthenics/) about it.
38. **Learn About Old Culture** – History is boring? Only in school. Did you know that the Mayan culture had a custom number system, and a sophisticated calendar, and created even artificial soil? And recently, archeologists found out their culture was much more advanced than we thought. With Lidar (light detection and ranging) they [scanned a small amount](https://youtu.be/SwihfJgRRvs) of the Yucatán jungle and [found buildings for millions of people](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/).

## Things I Carry Around Every Day

A few days ago _Ryan Holiday_ posted the essay [Here’s Some Stuff Worth Carrying With You Everywhere](https://ryanholiday.net/heres-some-stuff-worth-carrying-with-you-everywhere/) with an accompanying [video](https://youtu.be/oaXMijw241c) on his blog.

Ever since I read the article [Meet the men obsessed with carrying all the right stuff](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/24/20696487/everyday-carry-reddit-knife-wallet-gun) on Vox, I had the plan to write a similar article, but never had the time to do it.

## Apple iPhone

In my left pocket, I carry my [iPhone 13 mini](https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/), 64 GB in black. It’s super fast and the best phone I ever had. I get a new phone every two years with my mobile contract. I use the <ProductLink asin="B09CPDV96X" text="RhinoShield SolidSuit Carbon" /> with a <ProductLink asin="B09W25VD13" text="3D Impact Protection Screen" /> to protect it.

When I’m at home, I put my iPhone into a drawer, as to not be constantly distracted by it.

## Amazon Kindle Paperwhite

I always carry my <ProductLink asin="B00QJDU3KY" text="Kindle Paperwhite" /> (_7. Generation_) with me. It’s either in my backpack or in the pocket of my jacket. If I have a few minutes of spare time, I read [my books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/28460819-stefan?shelf=currently-reading).

## Apple Watch

On my left arm I wear an [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/) (_Series 5_) in space grey with a white breathable sports wristband.

## Apple AirPods Pro 2

I bought in December 2019 the AirPods Pro and used them nearly everyday. In 2023 I switched to the [AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/). I put them in the small pocket of my jeans. They are fantastic headphones, as they shield all the noise while riding on trains or planes.

## Traveler’s Notebook

In my jacket, back pocket, or bag I always carry a [Traveler’s Notebook Passport Size](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-passport) in _Camel_. I have [2-3 paper notebooks](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/refill-passport) in it. I have a [Traveler’s Notebook Regular Size](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-regular) but don’t carry it with me around.

I bought my notebook at [Property Of…](https://thepropertyof.com/) and the leather embossing of my initials was included.

My favorite pen is the [MUJI Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen 0.38 mm](https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&Sub=52&PID=11044) with _black ink_. It’s not smudge-proof, and I have other pens for Sketchnotes, but the writing experience of this one is good. Additionaly, I have the [Brass Ballpoint Pen](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/brass/ballpointpen-2020) with me, because it is so small and has a pencil hidden inside.

## Laguiole Pocket Knife

I bought my [Laguiole](https://forge-de-laguiole.com/) pocket knife a few years ago, and it is always in my right pocket. It’s a traditional French knife handmade by craftsmen from Aubrac. Every knife is a unique piece and the artist carves a special pattern on the back of the knife. It’s available in all price ranges. The handle of my knife is made from ebony wood.

I always carry one because [Every Man Should Carry a Pocket Knife](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/every-man-should-carry-a-pocket-knife/).

## Secrid Miniwallet

For more than 8 years, I own a [Secrid Miniwallet](https://secrid.com/wallets/miniwallet), carried in my right pocket. It’s now old, I can’t even tell the original color, but I assume it was gray. A co-worker showed this Dutch brand to me, and I was instantly amazed. I always loved small wallets, but this one is the best.

It is made from leather covering an Aluminum case, preventing unwanted **RFID** and **NFC** communication or bending and breaking of the cards. It has a super cool mechanism to release the cards. Not only that, but it can hold **4-6 cards** in the case and another 4 cards inside. The plastic clip can hold banknotes.

## Keys and Keychain

I have all my keys attached to a <ProductLink asin="B00QJDU3KY" text="KeyUnity KM01 Titan Keychain" />, that is attached to my belt loop.

I try to limit my keys to the minimum amount: House door, flat door, cellar, letterbox, and bicycle lock.

## EDC Multitool Credit Card

I have a <ProductLink asin="B09Y8S3DZ7" text="survival credit card" /> in my Secrit Miniwallet. Mine was part of a survival kit, but you can find many different options. It has a small and a large screwdriver, an emergency life rope, ruler, twine knife, bottle opener, can opener, hanging hole, cutting saw, a knife, and a wrench.

## Urban Assault 21 Backpack

When I’m on the road I carry the <ProductLink asin="B07MTCXJ83" text="Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21" />. It’s the best backpack I had so far, recommended by a Green Beret. It’s waterproof and lightweight. In its pockets I store additionaly useful things, for example loading cables, a power bank, a pen roll, an umbrella, and a <ProductLink asin="B07TXY8GKN" text="water bottle" />. I might also carry my iPad Pro or MacBook Pro with me.

In case of a catastrophe, when I'm at home, I have a [fully packed backpack](/how-to-prepare-for-the-worst-case/) containing everything I need to survive for a few days up to several weeks.

That’s it, feel free to share your **Everyday Carries** in a blog post or photo: Hashtag [\#edc](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/edc/) and [#everydaycarry](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/everydaycarry/). I’m curious about what other people carry around.

## A Film by Yann Arthus-Bertrand

Yann Arthus-Bertrand, the filmmaker of [Home](https://youtu.be/jqxENMKaeCU), artist, photographer, and specialist for aerial photography worked 3 years on his new movie: [Human](http://www.human-themovie.org/).

He collected real-life stories from more than **2000 women and men** in **60 countries**. Stories about topics, which matter to us all: poverty, war, homophobia, the future of the planet, love, and happiness. It’s a beautiful mix of moving stories, impressive aerial images, and ground photography.

The [beautiful music](https://open.spotify.com/album/3c3Rjr62DwuQdyUW2P3aZm) was created by **Armand Amar**, who also composed the music for [Home](https://open.spotify.com/album/6xqTKyFLFSdGTzhK75wSRQ).

The movie was released in plenty of different formats and lengths. On the Internet is an **extended version** available, which contains 3 volumes with 90 minutes each.

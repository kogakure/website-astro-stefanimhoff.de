description: On the advantages of building yourself a morning routine and the details of my morning routine.

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about habits and routines. Iâ€™ve had always routines in my life, but I wanted to build a better morning routine because Iâ€™ve come across many sources, that emphasized the importance of routines for success in life.

You are not automatically successful with routines, but itâ€™s unlikely to be successful or happy without one. **Jordan Peterson**, a clinical psychologist, author, and speaker, mentioned in his talk [2017 Personality 02/03: Historical & Mythological Context](https://youtu.be/HbAZ6cFxCeY?t=1h36m32s) the importance of a schedule and routine:

> You need to pick a time to get up, whatever time you want, but pick one and stick to it because otherwise you dysregulate your circadian rhythms and they regulate your mood.

A morning routine does not only give health benefits, but if you include time for learning, reflection, thought, and fitness, you will improve in all aspects of life.

After reading many articles, and watching plenty of talks about morning routines, a similar pattern appeared in all these routines. I sat down a month ago and created a routine for myself, which included these patterns. I took inspiration from [Tim Ferris](https://youtu.be/LHAyE0UC5I4), [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/my-morning-routine/), and other [inspiring people](https://mymorningroutine.com/routines/).

## My Morning Routine

- **Wake up** at 7:00 AM
- **Read** in bed for an hour
- **Get up**, make my bed, move, and do stretches
- Open the windows everywhere to get **fresh air** in
- Record weight
- **Drink** something
- **Learn** languages for 15 minutes
- **Workout** with Calisthenics for 30-45 minutes
- Bathroom & Clothes
- **Meditate** for 15-20 minutes
- Prepare and eat **breakfast** while reading RSS Feeds
- **Prepare for the day**, by checking the **calendar** and selecting **To-Do** items for the day
- Get Ready

I do this routine every day, the only difference is, that I do not use an alarm clock at the weekend, but instead wake up when I wake up, which is around 7:00 AM. Iâ€™m doing it now for a month, and Iâ€™m happy with it. **Update 2022**: I donâ€™t use alarm clocks anymore, I donâ€™t need them, and I always wake up at the same time.

## Details of My Morning Routine

### Wake up

I wake up at 7:00 AM, after 7 hours of sleep. I donâ€™t have any electrical devices in my bedroom (no phones, tablets, cables, and TV), except two-bed [Slamp](https://www.slamp.com/en/products/table/bach-table/) lights, which turn on automatically (during winter) at 7:00 AM (with [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/) light bulbs) and my [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com) box, which plays a wake-up [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/kogakure/playlist/4w4fnIgjcpUHJibrxJxMtO) for 5 minutes, which consists of a mix of classical, chill out, soundtrack, and electronica music. Likewise, I canâ€™t hit a snooze button because there is none. And my box is standing unreachable, I need to get up to mute it. I get woken up by my Fitbit armband, which records my sleep.

I like waking up that early because it is silent outside and I have more time for reading. Likewise, I would love to join the **5 AM Club**, but currently, this is too early for me.

### Read

Reading is _honestly_ the most satisfying thing I do in the morning. I have never done it before and read on the commuting or in the evening. But reading in the morning is different. My mind is much clearer, and Iâ€™m able to read much harder books.

I have a [Travelerâ€™s Notebook Passport Size](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-passport) with a ball pen and my [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QJDO0QC?tag=raycastai-20) (or paper books) on my nightstand. The first thing I do after waking up is to turn on my belly and read in this position for an hour. Itâ€™s a good exercise for the back and stretches the opposite of the C-bend shape people sit in during the day.

I start by reading the daily chapter of the fantastic book <cite><AffiliateLink asin="1781257655" text="The Daily Stoic" /></cite>. The Stoic practice is the best start to a day you can have. Thereafter, I read 1-2 books, not novels, but harder topics (philosophy, science, or psychology). If I want to remember a quote or part of a book, I mark it and extract it later into my Commonplace book or write it down in my pocket-size notebook.

### Get Up

Then I stand up and get up, and make my bed. [Because if you want to change the world, start by making your bed](https://youtu.be/3sK3wJAxGfs), says **William McRaven**, a former US Navy Admiral and Navy SEAL:

> If you wanna change the world, start off by making your bed. If you make your bed every morning, youâ€™ll have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and encourage you to do another task, and another, and another. And by the end of the day, that one task completed, will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact, that the little things in life matter. If you canâ€™t do the little things right, youâ€™ll never be able to do the big things right.

It gives me movement, and I add stretches and occasionally Burpees.

### Fresh Air

I open the windows to all the other rooms to let in the fresh air. My bedroom always has fresh air during the night.

### Record Weight

I step on my [Nokia Body Cardio](https://www.withings.com/de/de/body-cardio) scale to measure weight, fat, muscle, bone, and water. Itâ€™s important to always do this every day at the same time. Itâ€™s the only way to see health trends early.

### Drink

Next, I drink a glass of juice (no added sugar), this will refill lost water of the night and add quick energy for the workout.

### Learn

Then I learn languages for 15 minutes. I pick up three tasks and practice them. These 10-15 minutes add to 5-7 hours at the end of the month.

I learn a few minutes [Japanese](https://en.duolingo.com/course/ja/en/Learn-Japanese) or [Spanish](https://en.duolingo.com/course/es/en/Learn-Spanish) with Duolingo.

### Workout

I do [Calisthenics](/calisthenics/) three times a week. I start with a warm-up, followed by a full-body workout, including pulling, pushing, core, and leg bodyweight exercises. In the end, I do skill work like working with rings or practicing handstands. The workout lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. Twice a week, I run instead for 15-30 minutes.

After the workout, I do headstands and stretching.

### Bathroom & Clothes

Then I take a shower. The benefits of cold showers are well-known, but I take a warm one. In the end, I switch to a cool temperature for a minute. I shower my legs in ice-cold water, but not the whole body. Iâ€™ll leave this to [Wim Hof](https://youtu.be/OpTG02x6w5o). ðŸ˜„

I put on my clothes, which is easy since I changed my style to a [minimalistic](/minimalism/) one: black jeans, a black, gray, white, or colored shirt, and a belt. Furthermore, I took inspiration for my wardrobe from filmmaker Matt Dâ€™Avella, who [showed his wardrobe in this video](https://youtu.be/DSHsIOIhjJY).

### Meditate

Subsequently, I sit down on a <AffiliateLink asin="B002JJ6UA4" text="meditation mattress" /> and on a <AffiliateLink asin="B01MRX5V3J" text="meditation pillow" />. I use the [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) app to meditate for 20 minutes. In cold seasons, I wrap myself in a big blanket to stay warm.

### Breakfast

My breakfast consists of 5 different types of cereal (oats, spelt, barley, rye, rice), corn flakes, poppy, sesame, linseed, almonds, hazelnuts and Brazil nuts, amaranth, and dark chocolate flakes. I add cinnamon and honey and mix everything. I drink coconut water and a glass of juice while reading my RSS Feeds.

### Prepare For the Day

I prepare for the day, by checking my **calendar** for upcoming events, meetings, and birthdays. I open my **To-Do** app [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) on my tablet and select my tasks for the day.

## Conclusion

Iâ€™m happy with my routine for now and hope you see the benefits of building a routine in your life. The morning routine is for me the one with the most benefits. Because if you start your day successfully, the chances are high that you end the day successfully. And as _Jordan Peterson_ said: <q>You cannot be mentally healthy without a routine.</q> I recommend, building yourself a morning routine.

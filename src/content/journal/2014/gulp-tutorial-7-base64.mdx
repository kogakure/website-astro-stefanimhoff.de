This is the 7th part of my series, _Introduction to Gulp.js_. Today, I will use Gulp.js to replace a lot of my URLs with small images with Base64 encoded images.

The last task executed by my `build` task is one, which replaces the URLs of small images in my CSS files with Base64 encoded images. This way, the images get embedded into the CSS file and don’t need an additional server request. If the images are not too large, this will speed up the loading of my website a lot.

I use plenty of small patterns on my website because I don’t like the _Flat Design_ approach a lot. The physical world isn’t flat. Nowhere. There is always structure, pattern, shade, and light. The patterns I use are from the fantastic website [Subtle Pattern](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/). They have a few hundred nice subtle patterns.

To load the background pattern, I use SCSS like this:

```scss
%pattern-light-grey {
  background-color: $background-color;
  background-image: url(/assets/images/patterns/light_grey.png);
  background-size: 301px 621px;
}

body {
  @extend %pattern-light-grey;
}
```

The generated CSS looks like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: #fdfdfd;
  background-image: url(/assets/images/patterns/light_grey.png);
  background-size: 301px 621px;
}
```

After the task ran, the CSS will look like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: #fdfdfd;
  background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAloAAATaBAMAAAB4FdU7AAAA…);
  background-size: 301px 621px;
}
```

For this task, I will need another Gulp.js plugin:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-base64@0.1.2
```

I add a new configuration entry and create the task:

#### gulp/config.js

```javascript
base64: {
  src: developmentAssets + '/css/*.css',
  dest: developmentAssets + '/css',
  options: {
    baseDir: build,
    extensions: ['png'],
    maxImageSize: 20 * 1024, // bytes
    debug: false
  }
}
```

I replace images with the ending PNG and if they have a maximum of 20 KB of size. This way, my high-resolution images don’t get embedded into the CSS file.

#### gulp/tasks/development/base64.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var base64 = require("gulp-base64");
var config = require("../../config").base64;

/**
 * Replace urls in CSS files with base64 encoded data
 */
gulp.task("base64", ["sass"], function () {
  return gulp.src(config.src).pipe(base64(config.options)).pipe(gulp.dest(config.dest));
});
```

We are now finished with the development `build` task.

## Conclusion

This concludes the 7th part of my series, _Introduction to Gulp.js_. We learned how to replace URLs to PNGs with Base64 encoded images. And we are now finished with our `build` task.

This is the 2nd part of my series, _Introduction to Gulp.js_. Today I will write the first few Gulp.js tasks and set up a development server with BrowserSync. And I will start to write a configuration file.

## Installing Gulp.js

To run my `gulpfile.js` I need to install gulp:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp@3.9.0
```

If I run the command `gulp` on my command line, I get an error message <samp>Task 'default' is not in your gulpfile</samp>. This is because I haven’t written a gulp task until now.

I create inside the `gulp/tasks` folder a file `default.js` and write this code:

#### gulp/tasks/default.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

gulp.task("default", function () {
  console.log("Hello Gulp.js!");
});
```

I know … I said I’m sick of _Hello World_ tutorials, but this won’t last very long. I’ll soon replace it with valuable code. Stay with me.

If you execute the command `gulp`, this Gulp.js task will output <samp>Hello Gulp.js!</samp> to the console.

I will speed up the pace from now on.

## Watch

Instead of calling a function and outputting text to the console, I can execute tasks. I decided to execute the watch task when running `gulp`. This task will later watch for changes in files and update my files.

#### gulp/tasks/default.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

gulp.task("default", ["watch"]);
```

It’s possible to run multiple tasks at once, which is why I write my `watch` task in an Array. Be careful: These tasks will run in parallel, not in sequential order. Later I will show how to run tasks in a predefined order.

I will create another folder within my `tasks` folder with the name `development` and put all tasks needed for development in this folder. This is not necessary, but I did so:

#### gulp/tasks/development/watch.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

/**
 * Start browser-sync task and then watch files for changes
 */
gulp.task("watch", ["browsersync"], function () {});
```

I will come back later to write the `watch` task. For now, the function will be empty, and run another task before running the watch task: `browser-sync`. All tasks within the Array will be executed _before_ the task is executed.

## BrowserSync

You might have heard of [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/), a tool that is watching for changes in your files and automatically reloads the server. With Stylesheets, even reloading is not needed. The page refreshes with the changes instantly.

But [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) is even better: It does all LiveReload does, but you don’t need a browser plugin, and it syncs your actions like a scroll, click, refresh, or filling out forms to all browsers connected. This works even with mobile devices. And BrowserSync even has support for a development server. That’s why I will need nothing more than BrowserSync to get a development server with live reloading.

But first, I install BrowserSync:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev browser-sync@2.9.11
```

I create a new file `browser-sync.js` in `gulp/tasks/development/`. This file will start BrowserSync and the development server.

#### gulp/tasks/development/browser-sync.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var browsersync = require("browser-sync");
var config = require("../../config").browsersync.development;

/**
 * Run the build task and start a server with BrowserSync
 */
gulp.task("browsersync", ["build"], function () {
  browsersync(config);
});
```

This code does need explanation: First, I load Gulp.js and BrowserSync, which are needed in this task. Then I load the configuration for BrowserSync. I will create this configuration file shortly. Keeping all configurations out of the tasks will make them more usable, and they can be shared between different projects.

The second thing worth mentioning is `['build']`. This does mean before starting BrowserSync it first will run the `build` Gulp.js task (which I will write later). Every Gulp.js task needs a name. As a second parameter, you can either add a JavaScript callback or tasks, or both.

## Configuration

I create a new file `config.js` in the main Gulp.js folder:

#### gulp/config.js

```javascript
var src = "app";
var build = "build";
var development = "build/development";
var production = "build/production";
var srcAssets = "app/_assets";
var developmentAssets = "build/assets";
var productionAssets = "build/production/assets";

module.exports = {
  browsersync: {
    development: {
      server: {
        baseDir: [development, build, src],
      },
      port: 9999,
      files: [
        developmentAssets + "/css/*.css",
        developmentAssets + "/js/*.js",
        developmentAssets + "/images/**",
        developmentAssets + "/fonts/*",
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

First I extract paths needed over and over again later to variables, and then I create a CommonJS module and add an entry for BrowserSync. BrowserSync runs with default options, but I want to override the port and I tell BrowserSync which folders should be served.

Jekyll wipes out all files on recreation and to speed up development I have to be creative because I don’t want to recreate all assets on every Jekyll build. That’s why I serve more than one folder. I serve the folder `build/development`, which will hold the files created by Jekyll. The assets I will generate into a different folder, `build/assets` that Jekyll doesn’t wipe out. And additionally, the folder `app/_assets` to link source maps later.

BrowserSync watches my asset files, in order that my browser won’t reload like hell, every time Jekyll creates one file. I will later write one task, which reloads the Browser one time after the Jekyll build is complete.

## Conclusion

This concludes the 2nd part of my series _Introduction to Gulp.js_. We learned how to install Gulp.js, write a Gulp.js task, run other tasks, and set up a development server with BrowserSync.

This is the 15th part of my series, _Introduction to Gulp.js_. Today I’ll add tasks for performance improvement of the website with WebP for images and Gzip for text files.

## Using WebP for images

[WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) is a new image format developed by Google. With WebP, it’s possible to achieve much better compression with better quality, as with JPEG or PNG. Multiple browsers like **Google Chrome**, **Opera**, or **Konquerer** support this image format.

On my website, I use a header image which is in JPEG format **69 KB** in size, the same image is in WebP **44 KB**. WebP can reduce the size of images by **25-34%**, which is a lot.

That’s why I will create a task, which creates WebP images of my PNG and JPEG images and let the server deliver the smaller format to browsers, which supports it.

First, I install the Gulp.js module for WebP:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-webp@2.1.1
```

I add an entry to the configuration file:

#### gulp/config.js

```javascript
webp: {
  src: productionAssets + '/images/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}',
  dest: productionAssets + '/images/',
  options: {}
},
```

The task is short and straightforward:

#### gulp/tasks/production/webp.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var webp = require("gulp-webp");
var config = require("../../config").webp;

/**
 * Convert images to WebP
 */
gulp.task("webp", function () {
  return gulp.src(config.src).pipe(webp(config.options)).pipe(gulp.dest(config.dest));
});
```

This task needs to be run for production and has to be executed after the revisioning of the images is finished because the server will deliver a WebP image of the same name to the browser.

#### gulp/tasks/production/build.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var runSequence = require("run-sequence");

/**
 * Run all tasks needed for a build in the defined order
 */
gulp.task("build:production", function (callback) {
  runSequence(
    "delete",
    "jekyll:production",
    // ...,
    "revision",
    "rev:collect",
    "webp",
    callback
  );
});
```

It’s necessary to tell the server to rewrite the URLs of our images. There are multiple techniques for this, but I’ll use a `.htaccess` file:

#### app/htaccess

```apache
---
layout: null
slug: .htaccess
---

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} image/webp
  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.webp -f
  RewriteRule (.+)\.(jpe?g|png)$ $1.webp [T=image/webp,E=accept:1]
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header append Vary Accept env=REDIRECT_accept
</IfModule>

AddType image/webp .webp
```

It is possible to use a `.htaccess` file and include it in the [configuration file](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/). Otherwise, Jekyll will ignore hidden files and don’t copy them to the target directory.

But I like it more to add [YAML Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and create the file this way. Another advantage is that the file isn’t invisible.

If you sync your production website to a server, it will deliver to browsers, which support WebP the WebP format when requesting a JPEG or PNG.

Don’t wonder: The `.htaccess` file won’t work with the development server. It will need a server with support for `mod_rewrite` and `mod_headers` and support `.htaccess` files.

## Gzip text files

Many servers compress files by default with Gzip before sending them to the browser. But it is always good to pre-gzip the files because it will be faster, as the server doesn’t need to compress the file on every request. And it will need less CPU and the compression rate will be much higher with pre-gzipped files because many servers don’t use the maximum compression rate.

First, I install the Gulp.js module:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-gzip@1.2.0
```

I add an entry to the configuration file:

#### gulp/config.js

```javascript
gzip: {
  src: production + '/**/*.{html,xml,json,css,js}',
  dest: production,
  options: {}
},
```

Next, I create the task, which is short:

#### gulp/tasks/production/gzip.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var gzip = require("gulp-gzip");
var config = require("../../config").gzip;

/**
 * Gzip text files
 */
gulp.task("gzip", function () {
  return gulp.src(config.src).pipe(gzip(config.options)).pipe(gulp.dest(config.dest));
});
```

I add the task in my production build file to a JavaScript Array together with the `webp` task because this task and the Gzip task may run in parallel; WebP works with images and Gzip with text files.

#### gulp/tasks/production/build.js

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var runSequence = require("run-sequence");

/**
 * Run all tasks needed for a build in the defined order
 */
gulp.task("build:production", function (callback) {
  runSequence(
    "delete",
    "jekyll:production",
    // ...,
    "revision",
    "rev:collect",
    ["webp", "gzip"],
    callback
  );
});
```

## Conclusion

This concludes the 15th part of my series _Introduction to Gulp.js_. We learned how to convert images to the WebP format and how to compress text files with Gzip. Every byte we can reduce will increase the speed of the website.

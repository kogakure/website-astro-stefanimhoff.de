## Webstandards-Magazine, Issue 07/2010

There it lay in my mailbox: My voucher copy of the current issue 07/2010 of the _Webstandards-Magazin_. This is a premiere for me because I wrote my first article for the Webstandards-Magazin.

It should be three pages long, now it has almost become five. It was not possible to put all the fascination for _Django_, code samples, and graphics into that little space. But the editors-in-chief of [Webstandards-Magazine](https://www.screengui.de/) _Ansgar Hein_ and _Jörg Morsbach_ were accommodating and gave me more space. Thank you again for that! I would like to thank the diligent helpers who have checked my article for content or spelling errors.

The article is not a tutorial with step-by-step instructions. But there are plenty of other good places on the internet for that. I wanted to clarify with my article, why I like Django and have stayed true to this web framework for more than four years, which is not self-evident because I am hard to please. I have used _TextPattern_, _WordPress_, _CodeIgniter_, _ExpressionEngine_, _ModX_, _Symphony_ and other web frameworks and CMS, but since I use Django, I have the feeling that I control and understand everything on my website.

Django gives me a clean, easy-to-read Python code that even full-fledged beginner programmers can read. Since I changed my martial arts magazine [kogakure.de](https://www.kogakure.de/) to Django in May 2008, I am Djangonaut. I would like to implement many more projects with Django, but unfortunately, the distribution of Django is not as big as Ruby on Rails or various Java frameworks.

Unfortunately, I did not manage to publish the article at the same time as switching to Django, because of missing time … But I work without pressure. Meanwhile, ExpressionEngine is doing its job. I hope you like my article and bring more to the Django community.

The _Webstandards-Magazin_, _Issue 07/2010_ with the topic _Tools_ will be published on **24/09/2010** in the station and airport bookstores for the price of **€7.80** or by subscription for four issues per year for €28. You can find my article on pages 83-87: <cite lang="de">Einstieg in Django. Vielseitig und leistungsstark: Vorstellung des Python-Frameworks für anspruchsvolle Webanwendungen</cite>.

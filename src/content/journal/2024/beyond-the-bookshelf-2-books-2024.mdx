In the previous article, we explored the transformative power of reading in our digital age, discussing how to build a meaningful reading practice through home libraries, effective reading techniques, and the integration of various reading formats. We learned that successful reading habits don't require dramatic lifestyle changes, but rather consistent, small efforts.

Putting these principles into practice, I read **66 books** with a total of **24,602 pages** in 2024, more books than I've ever read in my life. This achievement wasn't about racing through pages, but about creating sustainable habits that allowed for deep, meaningful engagement with diverse literature.

This essay offers insights into some of the books I've read and what I've learned. It also provides additional resources, such as videos, TV shows, and articles, for further exploration. To view the complete list of books I've read, please visit my [Goodreads 2024 Reading Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11634-2024-reading-challenge).

## Fiction

### The Foundation Series

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="B000FC1PWA" alt="Foundation" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B000FC1PWK" alt="Foundation and Empire" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B000FC1PWU" alt="Second Foundation" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B003EY7JC6" alt="Foundation’s Edge" />
  <AmazonBook asin="0593159993" alt="Foundation and Earth" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B003EY7JH6" alt="Prelude to Foundation" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B003EY7ICW" alt="Forward the Foundation" />
</Bookshelf>

I started the year by reading the last three books of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series. I read Foundation in German when I was a child, but in 2023, I decided to read all the books [in the order recommended by the author](https://www.howtoread.me/foundation-series-books-in-order/). I began with “I, Robot” from the Robot series, then moved on to the Empire series, and finished with the Foundation series.

It remains one of the best science fiction series, despite inconsistencies and weaker books. The story is fantastic, spanning thousands of years with two consistently appearing characters. If you first want to know if you like the story, you can start with the <AppleTVFlag id="5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3" /> Apple TV+ show that was released in 2021. While it took many liberties and made unnecessary gender and race changes, I found it entertaining.

### Cloud Atlas

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="0812984412" alt="Cloud Atlas" />
</Bookshelf>

I have watched the movie [Cloud Atlas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/) multiple times and have always liked it, even though the story is complicated and strange. This year, I decided to read the book, and I found that the story is similar to the movie; some chapters are nearly word-for-word from the book. However, the narrative structure differs. While the movie presents the stories in order and then quickly switches between them at the end, the book is structured like a pyramid, starting with the first story, moving to the fifth, and then going backward.

### Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="1529034523" alt="The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy" />
</Bookshelf>

I first saw the [2005 movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/) and am aware of the cult-like following of the book and the memes surrounding the number 42. However, I had never read the book before and wanted to give it a try. The book is fine, but it’s not my favorite, and its humor doesn’t quite resonate with me.

### Ted Chiang’s Short Stories

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="1035038595" alt="Stories of Your Life and Others" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1529014492" alt="Exhalation" />
</Bookshelf>

Somewhere, I heard Tim Ferriss recommend the short stories of Ted Chiang, so I decided to read them without any prior knowledge. Both books are collections of short stories. “Stories of Your Life and Others” includes two stories that left a lasting impression on me: “Tower of Babel” and “Story of Your Life.” As I read the second story, I realized I was familiar with it and discovered that the movie _[Arrival](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/)_ (2016) is based on this story, with the script co-written by Ted Chiang.

## Libertarianism and Economics

I have always scored as Libertarian on the [Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) test, but I wasn’t knowledgeable about the political movement. However, several events in the last years sparked my interest in exploring it further. First, the authoritarian measures during the COVID-19 pandemic made me more anti-state and libertarian than I was before, and I’m not the only person. Many people who endured lockdowns, social exclusion, and propaganda have taken the red pill and will never trust the web of lies spun by our politicians again. Ever. Klaus Schwab and the media are [really scared](https://x.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1744991248056770795) of the Libertarian movement, that wants to tear down their authoritarian control of governments into private life.

### Javier Milei

Multiple interesting events occurred in 2024 for Libertarianism. Javier Milei took office in Argentina as the first anarcho-capitalist president, bringing libertarianism into public consciousness with Minarchist policies. He used the chainsaw, his ‘Afuera’ aproach, and his strong opposition to statism and socialism to dismantle nearly 100 years of central planning, corruption, and hyperinflation, aiming to liberate the markets from regulation. The left-wing media attempted to discredit him as a nut job and a far-right Nazi, but his achievements are noteworthy. By the end of 2024, Argentina experienced 8 percent more economic growth than Germany.

### Renato Moicano

The second interesting aspect was the Brazilian mixed martial artist Renato Moicano. After winning a match in April 2024, he yelled into the microphone, “[Read Ludwig von Mises, motherf\*\*kers!](https://x.com/LegendaryEnergy/status/1779299683455861196)”[^Durden2024aa] This caused a significant spike in Google searches for [Ludwig von Mises](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=ludwig%20von%20mises).

In September 2024, during his victory speech, he insulted Macron and “[all the totalitarian globalists](https://x.com/MLiamMcCollum/status/1840162516992758077),”[^Bishop2024aa] urging people to read Hans-Hermann Hoppe, another prominent libertarian writer. This also led to a substantial increase in Google searches for [Hans-Hermann Hoppe](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F01hfv2). Thus, my libertarian reading journey of 2024 began.

### Ludwig von Mises

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="B09KWSZGVS" alt="Ludwig von Mises: Der kompromisslose Liberale" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1933550546" alt="Liberty and Property" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1522735925" alt="The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1933550015" alt="Economic Policy: Thoughts for Today and Tomorrow" />

  <AmazonBook asin="0865976643" alt="Bureaucracy" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B004FN2COA" alt="The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B0022NHOL6" alt="Human Action: Scholar's Edition" />
</Bookshelf>

I began with a free audiobook, a biography of Ludwig von Mises by Thorsten Polleit titled _[Ludwig von Mises: Der kompromisslose Liberale](https://www.miseshoerbuch.de/)_. It was fascinating to learn about Mises, one of the most significant economists in history.

I read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/liberty-and-property" /> _[Liberty and Property](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22303718-liberty-and-property)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/anti-capitalistic-mentality" /> _[The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75048394-the-anti-capitalistic-mentality)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/economic-policy-thoughts-today-and-tomorrow" /> _[Economic Policy: Thoughts for Today and Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714642-economic-policy)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/ludwig-von-mises-money-and-inflation" /> _[Ludwig von Mises on Money and Inflation: A Synthesis of Several Lectures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7983765-ludwig-von-mises-on-money-and-inflation)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/bureaucracy" /> _[Bureaucracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42612898-bureaucracy)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/ultimate-foundation-economic-science" /> _[The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19471086-the-ultimate-foundation-of-economic-science)_, and his masterpiece, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/human-action" /> _[Human Action: Scholar’s Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9207437-human-action)_. The scholar’s edition of this book was quite complex. I attempted to read it halfway through, then restarted and combined the audiobook with the e-book for better understanding. It is a dense and advanced economic text. You can get many of these books for free at the Mises Institute.

### Murray Rothbard

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="1933550481" alt="Anatomy of the State" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B076B4SW5T" alt="The Progressive Era" />
  <AmazonBook
    asin="0945466447"
    alt="What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar"
  />
  <AmazonBook asin="B005CR8E7C" alt="Economic Depressions: Their Cause and Cure" />
  <AmazonBook asin="0945466226" alt="Education: Free & Compulsory" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1610167317" alt="For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto" />
</Bookshelf>

I began reading books by Murray Rothbard, the founder of modern libertarianism, and a student of Ludwig von Mises. I started with his shortest work, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/anatomy-state" /> _[Anatomy of the State](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6613404-anatomy-of-the-state)_, which takes about an hour to read. This book is essential; everyone should read it. A free [German audio version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZVVXHj3qE) is available.

Next, I followed the recommended Libertarian books from the Mises Institute and read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/progressive-era" /> _[The Progressive Era](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36387450-the-progressive-era)_. Although this book is much longer, it is fascinating. It offers detailed insights into the history of the USA from the 1890s to the 1920s, a period when the laissez-faire state transformed into a welfare state. I believe this was the book I learned the most from in 2024. I now understand where Ayn Rand drew her ideas for her book _Atlas Shrugged_.

I read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/what-has-government-done-our-money" /> _[What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81977.What_Has_Government_Done_to_Our_Money_and_The_Case_for_a_100_Percent_Gold_Dollar)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/economic-depressions-their-cause-and-cure" /> _[Economic Depressions: Their Cause and Cure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19266553-economic-depressions)_, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/education-free-and-compulsory" /> _[Education: Free and Compulsory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81982.Education)_, and his most famous work, the libertarian bible: <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/new-liberty-libertarian-manifesto" /> _[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268994.For_a_New_Liberty)_. I learned a great deal from all these books, but the last one became my favorite. It addresses common questions people raise when Libertarians propose a stateless society, such as: Who will build the streets? What about police, firemen, and infrastructure? Rothbard offers logical answers to these concerns. Before reading Rothbard, I considered myself a Minarchist, but his arguments prompted me to explore more radical ideas like anarcho-capitalism.

### Hans-Hermann Hoppe

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="1610166906" alt="Getting Libertarianism Right" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B07BYL6ZJ6" alt="Democracy: The God That Failed" />
</Bookshelf>

If you read Rothbard, you’ll inevitably encounter Hans-Hermann Hoppe, a German libertarian and one of Rothbard’s students. His ideas are even more radical and intriguing. They were too extreme for the USA, so he now resides in Turkey. I started with his most famous book, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/getting-libertarianism-right" /> _[Getting Libertarianism Right](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41968667-getting-libertarianism-right)_, which presents fascinating and radical concepts. A free [German audio version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu7jHXs9E8s) is available. Next, I read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/democracy-god-failed" /> _[Democracy: The God That Failed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58112322-democracy)_, which is equally radical and also available as a [free audiobook](https://mises.org/podcasts/democracy-god-failed). Hoppe has given many lectures in English and German, which you can find on the [Mises Institute’s channel](https://www.youtube.com/@misesmedia) or by searching for his name on YouTube.

### Leonard Read

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="1479177067" alt="Anything That's Peaceful" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B003IWYFEO" alt="I, Pencil: My Family Tree As Told to Leonard E. Read" />
</Bookshelf>

I also read a book from Leonard Read, the founder of the [Foundation of Economic Education](https://fee.org) (FEE): <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/anything-thats-peaceful-case-free-market" /> _[Anything That’s Peaceful: The Case for the Free Market](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169362505-anything-that-s-peaceful)_. I knew Read before from reading his world-famous book, <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/podcasts/audio-essays/i-pencil" /> _[I, Pencil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2153998.I_Pencil)_, which shows that no one person can produce a pencil on his own, but thousands of people and industries around the globe are necessary to produce something as simple as a pencil. Both books are available for free.

I discovered FEE years ago when they released a fantastic video series on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FEEonline) called [Out of Frame](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa5yyWoUx0nXUeSpxDMqznYqIjjcgLKmc). The show ran for over five years and produced 70 engaging videos that explain economics, liberty, and libertarian values through examples from TV shows, movies, books, and comics. If you want to cut back on your streaming services and need something interesting to watch, I highly recommend this free series, it’s super entertaining!

### Other Books

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="B0BB8N2L78" alt="How to Think about the Economy: A Primer" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1933550376" alt="A Free-Market Monetary System and The Pretense of Knowledge" />
  <AmazonBook asin="099046315X" alt="Against the Left: A Rothbardian Libertarianism" />
</Bookshelf>

I read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/how-think-about-economy-primer" /> _[How to Think about the Economy: A Primer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62038714-how-to-think-about-the-economy)_ by Per Bylund, which was recommended by the Mises Institute. It’s a good book for beginners to start learning about economics.

Additionally, I read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/free-market-monetary-system-and-pretense-knowledge" /> _[A Free-Market Monetary System and The Pretense of Knowledge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090722-a-free-market-monetary-system-and-the-pretense-of-knowledge)_ by Friedrich A. Hayek, as well as <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/against-left" /> _[Against the Left: A Rothbardian Libertarianism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49093138-against-the-left)_ by Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr.

### Tuttle Twins

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="1943521190" alt="The Tuttle Twins and the Search for Atlas" />
  <AmazonBook asin="194352114X" alt="The Tuttle Twins and the Road to Surfdom" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1943521344" alt="The Tuttle Twins and the Fate of the Future" />
  <AmazonBook asin="194352145X" alt="The Tuttle Twins and the Messed Up Market" />
  <AmazonBook asin="B0BH27D6XY" alt="The Tuttle Twins and the 12 Rules Boot Camp" />
</Bookshelf>

While researching Ayn Rand’s _[Atlas Shrugged](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged)_, I came across a children’s book series by Connor Boyack and Elijah Stanfield called _The Tuttle Twins_. I was intrigued to find children’s books featuring humorous cartoons that explain the topics of economics and liberty. Out of curiosity, I ordered _[The Tuttle Twins and the Search for Atlas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36812244-the-tuttle-twins-and-the-search-for-atlas)_. It presents the story of _Atlas Shrugged_ in a simplified manner for children. I found out that of the 14 books, 12 are also available in German, so I ordered one for my 10-year-old nephew.

I ordered more for myself out of curiosity: _[The Tuttle Twins and the Road to Surfdom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33006285-the-tuttle-twins-and-the-road-to-surfdom)_ (based on _The Road to Serfdom_ by F. A. Hayek), _[The Tuttle Twins and the Fate of the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42978100-the-tuttle-twins-and-the-fate-of-the-future)_ (inspired by _The Anatomy of the State_ by Murray Rothbard), _[The Tuttle Twins and the Messed Up Market](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53083886-the-tuttle-twins-and-the-messed-up-market)_ (based on _Human Action_ by Ludwig von Mises), and _[The Tuttle Twins and the 12 Rules Boot Camp](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63113389-the-tuttle-twins-and-the-12-rules-boot-camp)_ (inspired by _12 Rules for Life_ by Jordan B. Peterson).

These books are humorous and recommended for ages 5 to 11. They also offer [many titles](https://tuttletwins.com/products/) for children aged 12 and up, covering topics like logical fallacies, biases, entrepreneurs, heroes, villains, conspiracies, hyperinflation, and more. Additionally, they provide books for toddlers, as well as iPad apps, cartoons, graphic novels, audiobooks, and translations in 13 languages.

<YouTube id="UGxUoJ-9HLU" />

They even have a [Tuttle Twins TV show](https://www.tuttletwins.tv) with two seasons, along with a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TuttleTwins) and Instagram accounts ([Tuttle Twins](https://www.instagram.com/tuttletwins/), [Tuttle Twins TV](https://www.instagram.com/tuttletwinstv/)).

### The Vampire Economy & Killing History

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="161016038X" alt="The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism" />
  <AmazonBook
    asin="B07T3G3X25"
    alt="Killing History: The False Left-Right Political Spectrum and the Battle between the 'Free Left' and the 'Statist Left'"
  />
</Bookshelf>

These days, political discourse is so embarrassing, as many people show their ignorance by throwing around insults like “fascist” or “Nazi” without even knowing what those terms mean. [TIKhistory](https://www.youtube.com/@TheImperatorKnight) is one of my favorite YouTube history channels that creates videos about these topics. He is a British YouTuber who has read an incredible amount of primary sources on these topics and can explain the ideologies in simple terms so that people understand the differences.

<YouTube id="eCkyWBPaTC8" />

He created a five-hour video titled _[Hitler’s Socialism: Destroying the Denialist Counter Arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkyWBPaTC8)_, which argues that National Socialism was a form of socialism. He also produced a shorter, condensed version lasting 40 minutes called _[Hitler’s Socialism: The Evidence is Overwhelming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLHG4IfYE1w)_. Additionally, he made an engaging video that compares national socialism, Italian fascism, and British fascism, titled _[Comparing the Ideologies of Hitler, Mussolini, and Mosley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvm8I1mnucM)_. Another noteworthy video highlights the differences between National Socialism and Fascism, called _[Fascism Defined: The Difference Between Fascism and National Socialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdY_IMZH2Ko)_. His playlist on [National Socialist ideology, politics, and economics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNSNgGzaledgxP4QadjKhk4bI6x2PbScO) currently contains 47 videos.

He recommended two intriguing books that I read in 2024: _[The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6611260-the-vampire-economy)_ by Günter Reimann and _[Killing History: The False Left-Right Political Spectrum and the Battle between the ’Free Left‘ and the ’Statist Left‘](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52800254-killing-history)_ by L. K. Samuels. The first book was particularly engaging because it uses letters and other primary sources to illustrate how the National Socialists took control of Germany’s industries.

The second book detailed how various socialist ideologies—such as socialism, national socialism, fascism, Leninism, Marxism, and Trotskyism—belong on the same side of the Left/Right spectrum. While some are positioned slightly more to the right than others, they are all fundamentally opposed to libertarian and liberal ideas. The author meticulously demonstrates that leaders such as Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky, and Mussolini viewed themselves and were perceived by the world as _Left_. However, Marxists have rewritten history to distance themselves from the crimes associated with 20th-century socialist ideas, aiming to preserve their utopian vision. To be historically accurate, these ideologies are, in fact, all _Right_ in the original context of how the French National Assembly was seated.

After watching the videos and reading the books, you will be able to counter Marxist propaganda, such as claims that Hitler was a fascist or that he wasn’t a socialist.

## Ideologies

This year, I decided to explore various books on ideologies, as they seem to be resurfacing as if the 20th century never occurred.

### Thomas Sowell

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="0465081452" alt="Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy" />
  <AmazonBook asin="0684864630" alt="The Quest for Cosmic Justice" />
</Bookshelf>

In 2024, I read two books by Thomas Sowell: _[Basic Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3023.Basic_Economics)_ (belongs in the economics section above) and _[The Quest for Cosmic Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86312.The_Quest_for_Cosmic_Justice)_. These were the last two on my reading list. In 2023, I had read a significant number of [Sowell’s books](/thomas-sowell/) the years before. _Basic Economics_ is a fantastic and accessible introduction to economics. It is detailed without being overly complicated.

### The Road to Serfdom

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="0226320553" alt="The Road to Serfdom" />
</Bookshelf>

I read Friedrich A. Hayek’s book <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/road-serfdom" /> _[The Road to Serfdom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18852353-the-road-to-serfdom---condensed-version)_, written between 1940 and 1943. In it, he warns of the danger of tyranny that inevitably arises from government control of economic decision-making through central planning. There is even a cartoon version available for free at the Mises Institute.

### Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="B0D4X3FPJ9" alt="Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis" />
  <AmazonBook asin="1610166337" alt="Marxism Unmasked: From Delusion to Destruction" />
</Bookshelf>

In 2023, I attempted to read Ludwig von Mises’ book <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/socialism-economic-and-sociological-analysis" /> _[Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154244.Socialism_An_Economic_and_Sociological_Analysis_by_Mises_Ludwig_Von_Author_ON_Jan_01_1981_Paperback)_, which has a foreword by Hayek, but I found it a bit too challenging at the time. However, this year I finally finished it. I also read <Flag label="M" href="https://mises.org/library/book/marxism-unmasked-delusion-destruction" /> _[Marxism Unmasked: From Delusion to Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53049929-marxism-unmasked)_ by Mises. Both books effectively dismantle the socialist economic model.

### Der Todestrieb in der Geschichte: Erscheinungsformen des Sozialismus

    alt="Der Todestrieb in der Geschichte: Erscheinungsformen des Sozialismus"

</Bookshelf>

The German economist [Markus Krall](https://x.com/Markus_Krall) recommended a fantastic book by a Russian dissident that explores socialist ideologies throughout history, long before the term “socialism” was coined. _[Der Todestrieb in der Geschichte: Erscheinungsformen des Sozialismus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33004424-der-todestrieb-in-der-geschichte)_ (_The Death Drive in History: Manifestations of Socialism_) is a captivating history book that examines socialist ideas from antiquity and around the world, highlighting their devastating consequences.

The second book recommended by Krall, who wrote the foreword, was even better and became one of my favorites of the year: _[Kreide für den Wolf](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4541821-kreide-f-r-den-wolf)_ (_Chalk for the Wolf_) by Roland Baader. His writing style is clear, direct, and harsh, which I greatly appreciated. He predicted that the fall of the Berlin Wall would not mark “The End of History” (as Fukuyama suggested) but rather the return of socialism, a trend we are witnessing today with increasing intensity within the European Union. I’ll dive into more of Baader’s books next year.

## Dystopian Books

There are several dystopian books that everyone should read at least once in their life: _[1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61439040-1984)_, _[Brave New World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World)_, _[Animal Farm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170448.Animal_Farm)_, and _[Fahrenheit 451](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451)_.

These works serve as warnings about political patterns that unfortunately resurface in our times. In Germany, this situation has an ironic twist. The Minister of Economy and Ecology, Robert Habeck, recently wrote the foreword for the German version of _1984_. He is a member of the eco-socialist Green Party that introduced many dystopian laws and prohibitions in the last 3 years. They are also main reason for the rapid decline of Germany’s industry. It is particularly striking that he does not recognize that the ruling party in _1984_, called INGSOC, stands for “English Socialism.” I must be cautious with my words, as he has already sued over 800 people for insulting his intelligence or competence in 2024. One persons house was raided by the police at 6 AM for posting the 💩 emoji on 𝕏 to the minister. So every German knows now who is talked about when someone says the word “Schwachkopf” (idiot). Streisand effect 😅

### Animal Farm

I had never read _[Animal Farm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170448.Animal_Farm)_, but I was familiar with the basic story of how a socialist farm of animals gradually turns fascist, leading to the murder of animals and actions typical of totalitarian regimes. However, I wanted to understand it better, which is why I finally decided to read it. It’s a book that every child should read.

### Fahrenheit 451

I have now read all the dystopian novels mentioned above, and _[Fahrenheit 451](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451)_ impressed me the most. Its language is poetic, and even though it is a dystopia, there is a glimmer of hope.

## Biography

### Hillbilly Elegy

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="0008220565" alt="Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis" />
</Bookshelf>

I watched <NetflixFlag id="81071970" /> _[Hillbilly Elegy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6772802/)_ on Netflix in 2020. I became aware of the movie because many critical articles about it were published by the left-leaning press. They seem to disdain the poor white communities in Appalachia because the existence of poor white people challenge their narrative of systemic racism and shows that poverty often arises from economic circumstances and poor life choices rather than racism. The film shows the hard life of growing up in Appalachia, with drug abuse and poverty everywhere. I remember the movie was well-made and going down a rabbit hole into Appalachia after watching it.

I discovered the YouTube channel [Soft White Underbelly](https://www.youtube.com/@SoftWhiteUnderbelly) by Mark Laita, which features interviews and portraits that explore the human condition. The channel presents heartbreaking stories filmed in black and white, covering topics such as drug abuse, prostitution, addiction, war, poverty, life, and love. One particularly shocking story is about the [Whittaker’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkGiFpJC9LM), an inbred family from Appalachia.

<YouTube id="nkGiFpJC9LM" />

I also found a fascinating [13-part documentary about Appalachia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyPgwIPkHo5If6xyrkr-s2I6yz23o0av) by Peter Santenello.

<YouTube id="p3O6bKdPLbw" />

This year, when I heard that J.D. Vance was running for Vice President alongside Donald Trump, I couldn’t believe that this J.D. Vance was the same person from the movie. I decided to read his biography, also titled _[Hillbilly Elegy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy)_, which is a fantastic book.

## Classics

### Edgar Allan Poe

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="B0955DHY32" alt="Edgar Allan Poe: The Ultimate Collection" />
</Bookshelf>

I watched the TV show <NetflixFlag id="81414665" /> _[The Fall of the House of Usher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15567174/)_ on Netflix in 2023 and thought it was one of the best shows of the year. I learned that the series is loosely based on several stories by Edgar Allan Poe. I decided to read a [collection of his stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199107682-edgar-allan-poe), but it wasn’t my cup of tea. However, the TV show is a must-see.

### The Brothers Karamazov

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="0140449248" alt="The Brothers Karamazov" />
</Bookshelf>

Another book I had wanted to read for more than 15 years was _[The Brothers Karamazov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov)_. It’s a good, lengthy book, but definitely not an easy read.

### The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

<Bookshelf>
  <AmazonBook asin="B09XMJK39V" alt="The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" />
</Bookshelf>

The longest book I’ve ever read, and probably the longest I will ever read, is _[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19400.The_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire)_ by Edward Gibbon. I always wanted to read it, but the sheer number of pages intimidated me. Although it is nearly 250 years old and has its flaws, it remains impressive for those interested in history.

From the book, I remember mostly that humans are murderous, sociopathic, and power-hungry. It details the killings of entire families and cities, including gruesome acts like skinning, ripping out nails, and cutting off noses and ears. It’s one murderous psychopath after another killing the previous one and his entire family, only to be killed along with his family by the next usurper, and so on. The cycle of murder, rape, pillaging, revenge, and atrocities continues for 1,500 years.

But I still recommend reading it because you can’t understand the present without understanding the past.

If you’re interested in history, I recommend two podcasts: _[Hardcore History®](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)_ by Dan Carlin, which features hour-long episodes on ancient and more recent history, all presented in an engaging manner. Another impressive show is the _[Fall of Civilization](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/)_ podcast, which currently has 18 episodes exploring the decline of various high civilizations.

_Lone Wolf and Cub_ (子連れ狼, _Kozure Ōkami_), is a brilliant manga by Kazuo Koike and with the visuals of Goseki Kojima first published in 1970. I have seen the many movies and TV shows in my teenage years and was always fascinated by the epic samurai adventure.

<YouTube id="4JSZ4vKAE2o" />

The lonely Rōnin and his young son in a wooden stroller with squeaky wheels have achieved cult status. Even Adult Swim, the studio behind Rick and Morty, created a two-part homage titled _[Lone Wolf and Cub: Samurai & Shogun (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSF5yoD-vC4)_ and _[Samurai & Shogun (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc184olN9Yg)_.

When a high-quality Master Edition was announced in 2022, I decided to buy it. It consists of 12 impressive volumes, each nearly 700 pages long. The final volume will be released in 2025.

The last manga series I started in 2024 was _Blame!_ by Tsutomu Nihei, who is also the creative mind behind the sci-fi anime _[Knights of Sidonia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398976/)_. I first heard about _Blame!_ in 2017 from [PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I4HDFSOc6U).

<YouTube id="6I4HDFSOc6U" />

In 2024, Dami Lee, one of my favorite architecture YouTube channels, made a video titled _[This Manga Took Me to a Strange Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ynSG5GLoQ0)_, focusing on the architecture in _Blame!_. This inspired me to buy the manga.

<YouTube id="_ynSG5GLoQ0" />

_Blame!_ is a six-part cyberpunk manga set in a bizarre, futuristic megastructure with unusual architecture. It has a dark and grim tone, featuring almost no dialogue. It is a pure work of art to appreciate. Additionally, there is a compelling 30-minute documentary titled _[Unraveling Blame!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqAuXw0wNWo)_ that explores the manga in greater depth. And Netflix has an anime adaptation of <NetflixFlag id="80115466" /> [Blame!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6574146/).

## Conclusion

In 2024, my reading journey took me through an expansive landscape of literature, from classic dystopian novels and epic manga series to profound economic and libertarian works. The books I consumed not only broadened my understanding of various subjects but challenged my existing perspectives, particularly in areas of economics, political philosophy, and societal structures. The diverse mix of fiction and non-fiction, ranging from Asimov’s Foundation series to the works of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, created a rich tapestry of knowledge and insight.

What stands out from this year’s reading is how historical works continue to illuminate our present circumstances. Gibbon’s extensive examination of Rome’s decline, the prescient warnings in dystopian classics like _Fahrenheit 451_, and the economic analyses of Austrian School thinkers all demonstrate that the challenges and patterns of human society repeat themselves. As we navigate an increasingly complex world, the wisdom found in these pages becomes ever more relevant. It reminds us that understanding the past and its lessons is crucial for shaping our future.

After I trained my first [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) diffusion model from photos of me, I wanted to try it out with different styles and topics.

Photo realism is still one of the hardest things to achieve with AI art. I wanted to see how close I could get to a photo realistic image of me.

This is my first use of Stable Diffusion’s [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet). It allows for fine-grain control of the outcome of the image. I used an outline sketch created in Procreate with a prompt and ControlNet to achieve this result.

The inspiration is the main character from Ayn Rand’s novell <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>.

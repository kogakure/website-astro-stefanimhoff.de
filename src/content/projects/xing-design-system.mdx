<ProjectIntro>
As the Senior Web Developer in the XING Design System Team, a dedicated team with multiple designers, QA, and developers for Android, iOS, and Web, I created more than 50 components with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) together with another developer.

We worked in collaboration with the Designers to develop and review the Design Specs for the [XING Platform](https://www.xing.com/) and extend our components.

We maintained and extended the components, wrote documentation, added demos, and supported the Web teams of the company implementing and using our components.

This is a reduced selection of the components. Most components come in multiple sizes and variations. Additionally, the Design System supports dark and light modes.

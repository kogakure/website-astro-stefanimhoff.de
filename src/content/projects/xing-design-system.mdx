<ProjectIntro>
As the Senior Web Developer in the XING Design System Team, a dedicated team with multiple designers, QA, and developers for Android, iOS, and Web, I created more than 50 components with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) together with another developer.

We worked in collaboration with the Designers to develop and review the Design Specs for the [XING Platform](https://www.xing.com/) and extend our components.

We maintained and extended the components, wrote documentation, added demos, and supported the Web teams of the company implementing and using our components.

This is a reduced selection of the components. Most components come in multiple sizes and variations. Additionally, the Design System supports dark and light modes. Please toggle the mode of this website to see both versions.

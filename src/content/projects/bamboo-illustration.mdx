title: Bamboo Illustration
sort: 90
categories: ["Illustration"]
description: I created the bamboo illustration in 2006 for my Martial Arts website using Adobe Illustrator and the gradient grid tool. 2015 I decided to use my bamboo as SVG on my website. Unfortunately, the gradient tool is not supported in SVG and I needed to recreate my bamboo with linear, radial, and other supported gradients in Affinity Designer.

<ProjectIntro>
I rebuild my website in 2020, which was one of the biggest personal projects I’ve ever created. The process of researching, designing, and coding the website took me nearly **3 years** with **250 hours** of work. I wrote extensively about the [new website](/new-website-2020/), the [inspiration](/new-website-2020-inspiration/) behind it, the [design](/new-website-2020-design/) process, and the [development](/new-website-2020-development/) process. I wasn’t happy with the technical solution I picked in 2020 which was overengineered and too slow for a personal project. So, in 2021 I changed the static website generator from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). The [relaunch](http://localhost:8080/new-website-2021/) brought also smaller improvements to the font and simplified the overall website.

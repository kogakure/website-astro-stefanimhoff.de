<ProjectIntro>
I was asked to create three new illustrations that could be used for an Onboarding screen on [XING](https://www.xing.com/). The screen was intended to let users choose their current working status.

One icon was needed for _Job Beginners_, one for _Professionals_ and one for _Retired People_. One of the objectives was to make sure the icons fit into the **XING illustration brand style guide**.

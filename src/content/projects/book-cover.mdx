description: I wrote this book in 2017 out of the essays I’ve written on my Martial Arts website in the last 20 years. It’s a book in German about the Ninja and their secret art of Ninjutsu. I also designed the book cover for my book. The book was written with GitBook and can be read or downloaded for free as PDF, ePub, or Mobi eBook.

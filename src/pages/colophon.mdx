## Design

- I designed the website myself in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/), using the Japanese art form of _shibui_ (Ê∏ã„ÅÑ) as a source of inspiration. To learn more about the process, please read the essays about the [inspiration](/new-website-2020-inspiration/) and [design](/new-website-2020-design/).
- The design uses the variable typeface [Secuela](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/secuela-variable) by [deFharo](https://github.com/defharo). I use a font scale that is based on the golden ratio, and the font scales automatically to the viewport size.
- The Bonsai image on my homepage took [Norio Nakayama](https://www.flickr.com/photos/norio-nakayama/9156103138).
- The minimalistic icons are by [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/), which is [Jimmy Cheung](https://github.com/xiaochunjimmy) and [Wendy Gao](https://github.com/wendygaoyuan).

## Technology

- The website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the all-in-one web framework.
- I write the code in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
- My essays are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows the usage of components in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) content.
- The layouts, templates, and components are written in Astro and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).
- I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for my styling.
- The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

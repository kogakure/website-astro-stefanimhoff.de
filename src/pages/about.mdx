I’m _Stefan Imhoff_, a Senior Front-End Web Developer, and Designer from Hamburg, Germany.

I find inspiration in a wide variety of media, from reading challenging and heterodox [books](https://goodreads.com/kogakure) about philosophy, science, and economics to listening to [podcasts](https://raindrop.io/kogakure/podcasts-24118384), watching [TV shows](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/kogakure/favorites/tv) and [movies](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/kogakure/favorites), and indulging in [Korean](https://www.themoviedb.org/list/8216385) and [Japanese](https://www.themoviedb.org/list/106001) dramas on Netflix.

As a passionate enthusiast of storytelling, I am convinced that humans understand the world and find meaning through narratives. This fascination has led me to contribute to the propagation of impactful ideas through my writing. Whether I am crafting [essays](/journal/), [Sketchnotes](/sketchnotes/), or [Haiku](/haiku/), I aim to use the power of storytelling to communicate messages that resonate with readers. I have even written a free [book about Ninja and Ninjutsu](https://www.kogakure.de/en/).

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring nature through activities such as [walking and cycling](https://hamburg.stefanimhoff.de/), and doing [Calisthenics](/calisthenics/). I have a keen appreciation for the beauty of everyday life and find joy in the small things. Whether it’s the peacefulness of a forest, the vastness of the sea, or the grandeur of a mountain, I am constantly inspired by nature’s magnificence. I enjoy both the power of thunderstorms and the warmth of sunny days.

I see myself as a 🔲 [Minimalist](/minimalism/), 🏛️ Stoic, 🎧 Introvert, 🐍 Libertarian, and ⛩️ Japanophile.

🔲 Minimalism allows me to simplify my life and focus on what truly matters. By owning only what I need and cherish, I am able to reduce clutter, increase my sense of contentment, and live with intention.

🏛️ Stoicism offers me a practical philosophy of life that emphasizes rationality, self-control, and virtue. By focusing on what is within my control and accepting what is not, I can develop a sense of inner peace, resilience, and purpose, even in the face of adversity.

🎧 As an introvert, I have a special relationship with silence. I’ll pretend to be out when someone knocks at my door unannounced (居留守), put on <q>Do Not Disturb</q> the whole day, and don’t answer calls from unknown numbers. With noise-canceling headphones as my trusty companion, I don’t need constant stimulation to be happy. And when it comes to socializing, I prefer quality to quantity.

🐍 Libertarianism is my political philosophy. I believe in the freedom of the individual, the sanctity of private property, and the power of the free market. I am convinced that the best way to improve society is to empower individuals to make their own choices and take responsibility for their actions. I despise authoritarianism, collectivism, and the abuse of power. <q>Don’t tread on me!</q>

⛩️ I have a deep appreciation for Japanese culture and aesthetics. From the simplicity and elegance of Japanese design to the philosophies of Wabi Sabi, Shibui, or Ikigai, I find myself constantly inspired. I am fascinated by the history of Japan, from the Samurai code of Bushidō to the ancient Shintō religion. I enjoy exploring traditional Japanese arts such as calligraphy and Sumi-e painting, and admire the natural beauty of Japanese gardens and architecture. Not only that, but I’m learning the Japanese language for a while, but I’m not fluent yet. Through my love for Japan, I seek greater meaning in life and cultivate a sense of harmony with the world around me.

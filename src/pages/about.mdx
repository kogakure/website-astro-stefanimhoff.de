I‚Äôm _Stefan Imhoff_, a Senior Web Developer from Hamburg, Germany.

I find inspiration in a wide variety of media, from reading challenging and heterodox [books](https://goodreads.com/kogakure) about philosophy, science, and economics to listening to [podcasts](https://raindrop.io/kogakure/podcasts-24118384), watching [TV shows](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/kogakure/favorites/tv) and [movies](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/kogakure/favorites), and indulging in [Korean](https://www.themoviedb.org/list/8216385-korea?view=grid) and [Japanese](https://www.themoviedb.org/list/106001-japan?view=grid) dramas on Netflix.

As a passionate enthusiast of storytelling, I am convinced that humans understand the world and find meaning through narratives. This fascination has led me to contribute to the propagation of impactful ideas through my writing. Whether I am crafting [essays](/journal/), [Sketchnotes](/sketchnotes/), or [Haiku](/haiku/), I aim to use the power of storytelling to communicate messages that resonate with readers. I have even written a free [book about Ninja and Ninjutsu](https://www.kogakure.de/en/).

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring nature through activities such as [walking and cycling](https://hamburg.stefanimhoff.de/), and doing [Calisthenics](/calisthenics/). I have a keen appreciation for the beauty of everyday life and find joy in the small things. Whether it‚Äôs the peacefulness of a forest, the vastness of the sea, or the grandeur of a mountain, I am constantly inspired by nature‚Äôs magnificence. I enjoy both the power of thunderstorms and the warmth of sunny days.

I see myself as a üî≤ [Minimalist](/tag/minimalism/), üèõÔ∏è [Stoic](/interpretation-if/), üéß Introvert, üè¥ [Ancap](/libertarianism/), and ‚õ©Ô∏è [Japanophile](/tag/japan/).

üß≠ These are the [rules, beliefs, and principles](/life-rules/) I live by.

üõ†Ô∏è These are the [tools](/tools/) I use.

### Design

- I designed the website myself in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/), using the Japanese art form of _shibui_ (<nobr>Ê∏ã„ÅÑ</nobr>) as a source of inspiration. To learn more about the process, please read the essays about the [inspiration](/new-website-2020-inspiration/) and [design](/new-website-2020-design/)
- The design uses the variable typeface [Secuela](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/secuela-variable) by [deFharo](https://github.com/defharo). I use a font scale that is based on the golden ratio, and the font scales automatically to the viewport size
- I created the Bonsai image on my homepage and other cover photos with [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/), [FLUX](https://blackforestlabs.ai/), [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet), and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/). My portrait photo was generated in Stable Diffusion with a custom LoRa model trainied in [FLUX Dev](https://replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer/train)
- The minimalistic icons are by [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/), which is [Jimmy Cheung](https://github.com/xiaochunjimmy) and [Wendy Gao](https://github.com/wendygaoyuan)

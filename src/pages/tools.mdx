## Home Office

My desk is a [Jarvis Bamboo Standing](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) Desk by Fully in 140¬†cm. The chair is a [Capisco](https://www.fully.com/chairs/for-standing-desks/hag-capisco-chair.html) by H√ÖG with black leather. I use a <ProductLink asin="B07PXDSSZP" text="black leather desk pad" /> in 75¬†cm. I use an aluminum <ProductLink asin="B01F01DRW6" text="MacBook stand" /> and a <ProductLink asin="B01M8HGTX8" text="bamboo book rest" /> on my desk. The <ProductLink asin="B07GGVNXSW" text="BenQ Screenbar Plus" /> provides good lighting. On top of the light is an <ProductLink asin="B09MFMTMPD" text="Anker PowerConf C200" /> webcam.

## Tech

My best computer is a [Mac mini M2 Pro with](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) 32¬†GB RAM and 1¬†TB SSD. It‚Äôs the fastest computer I‚Äôve ever had. For work I use a [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) 16", and I have another older MacBook Pro 15".

I use two [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2E3AM/A/magic-mouse-white-multi-touch-surface), one in white and one in black. My keyboard is a [Keychron K1 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) with brown [Gateron Low Profile Mechanical Switches](https://www.keychron.com/products/low-profile-gateron-mechanical-switch-set). I bought a wooden hand rest on Etsy.

The main display is an <ProductLink asin="B08FBH1V9R" text="LG 4K monitor" /> with 31.5‚Äù, the notebook display is my second screen. For sound, I use two <ProductLink asin="B07VVP8BGD" text="Creative Pebble" /> loudspeakers, but I have a [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/) sound system for music. When I am on the road, I use my [Apple AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/).

I have an [iPhone 13 Mini](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13) that I use when I‚Äôm not at home and an [iPad Pro M2](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) with an [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) that I use on the Sofa or when I‚Äôm creating digital crafts or notes. I can switch my Keychron keyboard to type on my Macs or the iPad.

Besides that, I have a few backup hard drives for automatic Time Machine backups. I use a [Synology DiskStation DS220+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS220+) NAS with two 6¬†TB hard drives in a RAID system with Docker containers as a media server, cloud backup solution, and for network-wide ad blocking with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). Additionally, I use a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 8¬†GB and [Linux Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) for redundancy for the DNS ad blocking.

## Development

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) as a plugin manager is my default code editor. I use it in the [Ghostty terminal emulator](https://ghostty.org/) with the [Tmux terminal multiplexer](https://tmux.github.io/). Occasionally, I use [Zed](https://zed.dev/). I use [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for Git.

## Design

I love the [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/) suite by Serif and use it for all my creative work. I ditched Adobe a few years ago and never looked back. Furthermore, I use all Affinity apps on Desktop and iPad. Additionally, I use [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) on my iPad Pro for creative work. Recently, I started using [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/) to organize my media assets, and I love the app! My favorite font app is [Typeface](https://typefaceapp.com/).

## Research & Writing

My favorite writing app is [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), I write nearly everything with it, but another writing app I use for my note-taking is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) is the app where I store everything, from PDF documents, to inspirational items to references. Everything is synchronized encrypted between all my devices.

[Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) is my favorite app to save any bookmark and to find anything again in seconds. I have more than 30,000 bookmarks.

I consume all my content with the [Reeder](https://reeder.app/) app, from RSS Feeds, to ùïè or Reddit threads, to YouTube videos. From there, I transfer everything to [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) to read it and create highlights to remember and review later in [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/stefan805).

## Other

I use many extra tools, too many to name them all. Here are a few of my favorites. I‚Äôve been using [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as my to-do app for years; I appreciate its simplicity and design. [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/pro) is my most-used app, with its ChatGPT feature. I‚Äôm a fan of [Brave](https://brave.com/) for its security, privacy, and built-in ad-blocking.

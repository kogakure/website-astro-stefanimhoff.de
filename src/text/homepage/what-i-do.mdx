For nearly two decades, I have been creating user-centric layouts for web-based devices of all sizes, and I take pride in bringing simplicity and minimalism to each of my projects.

I am passionate about providing excellent user experiences, which includes crafting well-written content, selecting appropriate photography, typography, and colors, programming efficient and maintainable code, and creating captivating animations.

Currently, I am employed as a Senior Software Engineer building the Design System of [XING](https://www.xing.com/), Europe's leading jobs network.

I am an avid innovator and have contributed to several projects, including a job platform for freelancers during one of the company's Hackweeks. I am also a five-time winner of both Hackweeks and Prototyping Days, a two-day company-wide prototyping event.

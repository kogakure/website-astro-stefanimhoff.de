Iâ€™m a *Frontend Developer* by profession. But I worked in previous jobs in Design, Editing, and 3D Animation. I even created Flash Animations and Multimedia CD-ROMs when this was a thing.

I like the concept of the [Renaissance Man](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man) and like to try out different skills.

These are projects I created over the last years.

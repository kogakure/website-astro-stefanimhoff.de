I’m a _Frontend Developer_ by profession. But I worked in previous jobs in Design, Editing, and 3D Animation. I even created Flash Animations and Multimedia CD-ROMs when this was a thing.

I like the concept of the [Renaissance Man](https://grokipedia.com/page/Polymath) and like to try out different skills.

These are projects I created over the last years.

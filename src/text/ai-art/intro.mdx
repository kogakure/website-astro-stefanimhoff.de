In the fall of 2022, I began using [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion). Initially, I used the amazing iPad OS app [Draw Things](https://drawthings.ai/). When I purchased a new Mac mini M2 Pro in the spring of 2023, I started using the [Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). I experimented with text-to-image and image-to-image generation, inpainting, upscalers, and over 100&nbsp;GB of different [diffusion models](https://civitai.com/). I also experimented with [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) and [LoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/lora). In May 2023, I created my first custom diffusion model in [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) by using 19 images of myself to train a model with my face.

I post my best work in this gallery and even more on my [AI Art Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/kogakure.ai.art/). If you are curious about prompts of my images, Iâ€™m happy to share them, just send me a <EmailLink data-domain="stefanimhoff" data-name="hey" data-tld="de" text="message." />
